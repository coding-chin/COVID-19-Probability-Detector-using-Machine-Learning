# COVID-19-Probability-Detector-using-Machine-Learning
Description of Idea:
The Idea is to stop the transimission by prioritising tests and hence detecting the case quickly.
Data can be collected on the symptoms of COVID.
A machine learning model is than trained on the data to find out the probablity of the person having COVID infection.
The model then used to find out whom to test for the infection initially under a limited testing capacity.
The same model can be used to find out the potential candidates for conducting tests.
